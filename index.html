                    <!--Intro paragraph describing year in games.-->
                    <p>2016 was a hell of a year for games.</p>
                    <p>I mean that in the best way possible; and it's part of a definite upward trend
                     for the industry. I think it's fairly uncontroversial to say that we were all generally
                     pretty high on the industry's output in 2015. However, 2015 was dominated by handful of
                     great AAA products. Every year end list looked exactly alike, and it left a good year
                     feeling fairly stagnant.</p>
                    <p>This year is undeniably different. While the AAA output this year was well-received,
                     it was the outstanding quality and abundance of games produced by talented independent
                     development studios that made 2016 shine. There were so many great independent games in 2016
                     that I'd be legitimately surprised to see any two top ten lists that were exactly the same.</p>
                    <p>In that vein, I wanted to share my ten favorite games of last year with our dedicated
                    <a href="www.pfb.rivercityarchery.club">Pizza for Breakfast</a> listeners, a grand total of
                    two of which were produced by AAA development studios.

                        Anyone who has ever worked in food service of any stripe knows the harrowing nature of the dinner rush. In
                        Ghost Town Games' <em>Overcooked</em> you and up to three of your friends can get a condensed taste of that
                        unique fear as you dash around a too-cramped kitchen, often filled with environmental obstacles, and yell at
                        each other because there is just too much to do and not enough manpower to handle it. And then your idiot friend
                        will accidentally drop a completed dish into the trash can instead of putting it on the service station, and you'll
                        have to stop for the night. It's fun, I promise. The last few years have either enjoyed or suffered a deluge of local
                        competetive and local cooperative multiplayer games, depending on who you ask. While I've personally enjoyed most of
                        the offerings that allowed my friends and I to get together and yell at each other, few really stuck around as mainstays.
                        I can't say that <em>Overcooked</em> will be included on that small list in the long run, but it's style, focused gameplay,
                        and dedication to making the game fun and playable at any player number made me care about a local co-op game
                        in the year 2016, which I honestly would have thought impossible.

                        <em>INSIDE</em> is Danish independent studio Playdead's follow-up to their 2010 debut, <em>Limbo</em>.
                        it is important to note this up front, as anyone who has played Playdead's previous offering will notice
                        many similarities between the beautifully silhouetted world of <em>Limbo</em> and the starkly but stunningly
                        constructed world of <em>INSIDE</em>. In <em>INSIDE</em> you play as a small boy, making your way through
                        a haunting world full of mindless drones, evil scientists, and strange monsters. The game's "story", as it
                        exists, is portrayed only through environmental storytelling that occurs inbetween and during the platforming
                        puzzles that make up the majority of the game. Yet, even though there are few explicitly expository moments
                        in the game, it still portrays a narrative that in turns thrilled and shocked me, culminating in what might
                        be the most powerful scene in any game I played this year. At only three to five hours long, I'm not sure
                        you can afford to not have played <em>INSIDE</em>.

                    <div class="description"><p>
                        As a long time fan of the <em>Idle Thumbs</em> podcast, hosted by two of the co-founders of Campo Santo, I
                        had been anticipating Campo Santo's first project since they announced their founding back in 2013. With the
                        pedigree that they brought with them from working on Telltale Games' most successful products, it should come
                        as no surprise that <em>Firewatch</em> is a thrilling narrative of a type that we rarely see in video games.
                        Playing as Henry, a newly employed fire lookout in a national park, you have to explore the wilderness surrounding
                        your tower in order to uncover the answers to a mystery that starts with the ransacking of your new watchtower home.
                        Your only other human interaction comes from the radio conversations you have with fellow lookout, Delilah. That and
                        the occasional shadowy figure you see in the distance. Although you are never at any real danger in <em>Firewatch</em>,
                        the game ratchets up the tension to a point that it can be physically uncomfortable to play. Although the story
                        falters in a final act twist that feels unearned, <em>Firewatch</em> is still an aesthetic masterpiece with dialogue
                        that is unmatched in the medium.

                    <div class="description"><p>
                        It's not entirely uncommon, even in this modern age of generally great voice acting, that game developers choose to have
                        their games be unvoiced. It's not even extremely rare that a game go without dialogue, written or voiced, entirely. It is,
                        however, remarkable when a game chooses to do both of these things while also purporting itself to be a narrative adventure
                        game. That is where we find ourselves with <em>Virginia</em>. The game plays like, and shares many similarities with, 90s
                        supernatural investigation shows like <em>The X-Files</em> or <em>Twin Peaks</em> -- where something feels wrong, just below
                        the surface, but the protagonists can never quite reach that which was never meant to be understood. With a visual style so
                        sharp it could kill, <em>Virginia</em> is nothing if not confident in what it is attempting to do. You walk down a hallway,
                        away from a crime scene, as music swells behind you. The game doesn't wait for you to hit the exit door, but instead, as the music
                        swells to a crescendo, smash cut to you and your partner in a car, driving down a dark road. It feels like playing a piece of art.
                        That being said, <em>Virginia</em> is a game that has slipped on and off of this list multiple times since I played it.
                        It is, ultimately, a narrative game with a narrative that, like <em>Firewatch</em>, fails in the last act. And it is perhaps
                        even less interactive than <em>Firewatch</em> or other narrative games of its ilk. Still, in the slow moments of the year, I still
                        find myself thinking of <em>Virginia</em>, and that has to mean something.

                    <div class="description"><p>
                        <em>Stardew Valley</em> is a game that I think will top a lot of Game of the Year lists around the internet, and it absolutely
                        deserves it. If you have ever in your life played a <em>Harvest Moon</em> or <em>Rune Factory</em> game, you know exactly what you're
                        getting with <em>Stardew Valley</em>. The game itself does little new to expand on many of the concepts found in those older farming
                        lifestyle sims, but instead takes all the best parts from all of them, throws in a dash of <em>Animal Crossing</em>, and polishes every
                        aspect to a mirror sheen. In <em>Stardew Valley</em>, you leave your city life behind to take on the tasks of planting crops, raising
                        animals, prospecting mines, making friends, and finding love in a tiny rural village. You'll harvest, fish, dig, build, and woo your way
                        to whatever goal you choose to set for yourself; waking up every new morning intending to just do your daily chores, but instead finding
                        something new and exciting to pursue in addition. In 2016, I needed something unrelentingly positive to pour my time into, and <em>Stardew
                        Valley</em> was there for me each and every time. Made largely by one man, <em>Stardew Valley</em> will go down as one of the best independent
                        games in the history of the medium.

                    <div class="description"><p>
                        The first of two AAA, big studio games that made it onto my final list this year is <em>Overwatch</em>, which might be most
                        easily described as Blizzard's perfection of the class-based FPS genre. Not that <em>Overwatch</em> needs any introduction;
                        if you play video games or even just exist in certain corners of the internet, the game has been impossible to avoid this year.
                        However, not content to let the game just ride on being "the best this genre has ever seen", let me attempt to specify a few easily
                        missed aspects that make the game as great as it is. First, Blizzard have created characters with such huge personalities that the
                        fact that the game lacks any sort of explicit story beats is almost entirely forgettable. The heroes (and villains) of <em>Overwatch</em>
                        are each wonderful in their own little ways, showing Blizzard's generally good character design skills at the peak of their prowess;
                        and they've taken the internet by storm. But it's not just the characterization that sells the game. The gameplay is best-in-class,
                        and has dozens of little tweaks to the traditional class-based FPS design that alleviate many of the genre's past failings -- not least
                        of which is the fact that Blizzard doesn't focus on the traditional "kill-death ratio" that many FPS games do, but instead highlight
                        all the good things you did over the course of a match. It's the perfect amount of end-of-game positivity needed to make you want to
                        queue for "just one more round".

                        <em>SUPERHOT</em> is a first-person shooter, although you might instead call it a first-person puzzle game, where the puzzle is men
                        with guns, and you solve it by shooting them and not getting shot. The kicker is, though, that in <em>SUPERHOT</em> time only moves
                        when you move. That means that you will see every single bullet flying in towards you, as a man with a katana approaches from your right,
                        and all you have within reach is an empty beer bottle. What do you do? The answer, of course, is grab the bottle, spin to the left to avoid
                        the first bullet, toss the bottle at the man with the katana to stagger him, dash back to the right to avoid the second bullet, knock out the man
                        with the katana, grab it from his hands, fling it at one of the shooters, run down the hallway while dodging the remaining shooter's bullets,
                        punch him in the face, take his gun, shoot him in the head, and then toss the empty gun at the wall. All of that took 5 minutes and 10 tries
                        of painstaking slow-motion planning to get right, but now you get to watch it in full speed, while the game screams at you: "SUPER, HOT, SUPER,
                        HOT." If you have to know one thing about <em>SUPERHOT</em>, know that it has changed the way developers are going to have to think about
                        first-person shooters from now on. That sounds hyperbolic, but in five years every big AAA shooter is going to have some trace of the
                        <em>SUPERHOT</em> DNA.

                        In many ways, there is no possible universe in which <em>Final Fantasy XV</em> should have been a good game. Announced ten years ago,
                        under a different title and for a different platform, the game had seemingly no chance of saving this franchise that has been slowly dying
                        for 10 to 20 years, depending on who you ask. And yet as it came back into the limelight over the last couple of years, I allowed myself to
                        have my hopes raised. As they announced that Florence and the Machine would be doing the theme song for the game, and there would be a
                        full-length CGI movie tie-in, and that they were releasing a six-episode anime miniseries leading up to the game's release, I couldn't tell
                        how to feel. And then November came, and we all sat down to play <em>Final Fantasy XV</em>, and not only was it better than I expected, but
                        it is in some ways better than I could have hoped. (I defended the much-maligned <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> series, and adored the hell out
                        of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> at a time in which I didn't think I could care about MMORPGs anymore, so maybe I'm a poor litmus test for this
                        particular instance.) Sure, it's not a perfect game. There are loads of well-known issues, particularly with the sparsity of exposition for
                        much of the game's plot. Yet it still feels good, and is fun to play, and I love the cast of boys, just going on a road trip to try to get
                        married and maybe save the world. With more patches, it's only getting better, and may be a big 2017 hit for people who pick it up cheaply
                        in the upcoming year. I sure hope so. I'd like to live in a world where <em>Final Fantasy</em> games are good again.

                        It has been a rough couple of years for rhythm games. Once upon a time the <em>Guitar Hero</em>es and <em>Rock Band</em>s of the world
                        seemed like they had no way of slowing down. They had reinvigorated rhythm games and turned into household names for games that your parents
                        have heard of, right next to <em>Mario</em> and <em>Wii Sports</em>. And then they died. The market was saturated and semi-annual releases
                        became too much and we got tired of owning dozens of plastic instruments. When they tried to make a return last year, they landed like a wet fart.
                        All of this is to say that <em>Thumper</em> could probably not have landed in an environment that was more hostile to rhythm games. In some ways,
                        then, it makes sense that <em>Thumper</em> responds to the player by being as hostile and opressive as possible. In <em>Thumper</em> you play a
                        shiny, fragile robotic bug, flying down a track towards an abstract, monstrous entity, slamming into walls and crashing through obstacles in time
                        to a bass-heavy industrial background song. It looks and feels like you're inside the cover-art of some new wave (or perhaps nu-metal) cover art.
                        It is mentally tasking, physically demanding, and opressively harmful, and I love each and every minute that I spend smashing myself against it.
                        Drool is a studio comprised of two ex-Harmonix developers, and their sense of love for rhythm games shines through in <em>Thumper</em> in a way
                        that makes me want to love the genre all over again.

                        Nothing, at all, consumed my time and my thoughts in 2016 like <em>The Witness</em> did. The game came out right at the beginning of the year
                        and has commanded my attention, in some form, ever since. <em>The Witness</em> is a puzzle game, and may be the greatest puzzle game that I have
                        ever played -- and I <em>really</em> like puzzle games. The game has only one mechanic through which to interact with its puzzles and its world,
                        and that is through tracing lines on mazes. That's it. You start your cursor at a round starting point and end at a straight ending point. That is
                        all the interaction you can have with the world. It should speak volumes, then, when I tell you that Jonathan Blow and Thekla Inc. have found a way
                        to create hundreds of puzzles (both obvious and secret) that utilize that mechanic over the course of dozens of hours that made me keep learning
                        new and exciting ways. As the game goes on, more and more rules are piled onto the simple maze puzzles, often in ways that directly contradict each
                        other, all culminating in what is probably one of the most exciting "boss battles" in the history of video games. The game lacks an explicit narrative
                        (and some might say it lacks even an <em>implicit</em> narrative), which definitely detracts from what could have been my favorite game of all time.
                        Instead, the game expresses itself through intro-level philosophy, ultimately conveying a theme and a thesis that I don't think I can even begin to
                        agree with -- but I appreciate that it attempted to say something at all.
